# CodeCore For Hire

Created by Matt Asaminew, Makoto Ejima, Wilson Lu,
Alaina Gully, Eric Richards, Salman Salem, and Ryan Woo.

We are apart of the Cohort 13 at CodeCore Bootcamp.
CodeCore For Hire was assigned as a group project and was
designed, developed, and implemented within one weekend.

## The Purpose of CodeCore For Hire

CodeCore For Hire allows CodeCore students to create a profile
that shows their credentials and if they are available for hire.
Through the site you can, sign up as a user, create a profile
page, and show if you are available for hire. You can also search
the site as a recruiter and see all of the student profiles,
search for hirable students, and message students for them to get
in contact with you.
